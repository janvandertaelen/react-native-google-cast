# react-native-google-cast

This library wraps the native Google Cast SDK for Android and iOS (and maybe web/Chrome in the future), providing a unified JavaScript interface.

It is written in TypeScript so types will always be up-to-date.

## Version overview

| RNGC | React Native | Purpose                                                                                                                                               |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.x  | 🤷‍♂️           | Old version implemented for Google Cast SDK v2 with manual discoverability. Not maintained anymore.                                                   |
| 3.x  | >=0.40       | Rewrite of the library for Google Cast SDK v3 with automatic session management. Only bug fixes will be merged.                                       |
| 4.x  | >=0.60       | Current version with a completely rewritten API, closely resembling native Android/iOS(/Chrome?) APIs. We highly recommend to use the latest version. |
